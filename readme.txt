Add extra fees to your WooCommerce checkout. Simple, flexible, and works with both classic and block checkout.

== Description ==

I built this plugin because I needed a straightforward way to add fees to WooCommerce orders. No complicated settings, no bloat - just fees that work.

**What it does:**

* Create as many fees as you need
* Make them required (always applied) or optional (customer chooses)
* Set conditions like "only apply if cart is over X amount"
* Works with WooCommerce taxes
* Compatible with both classic checkout and the new block-based checkout
* HPOS ready

**Common uses:**

* Handling or processing fees
* Gift wrapping
* Express shipping upgrades
* Insurance options
* Any extra service you want to offer

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate it
3. Go to WooCommerce → Simple Cart Fees
4. Click "Add Fee" and configure your first fee

That's it.
